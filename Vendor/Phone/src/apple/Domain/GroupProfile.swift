//
//  GroupProfile.swift
//  Minis
//
//  A group: several agents and the user in one conversation.
//
//  The shape is lifted from grok-bot 0.18's `group.json`
//  (modules/grok-bot-0.18-reconstructed/source/host/groups/group-store.ts):
//  a group is not a new kind of runtime, it is a roster plus a transcript. What
//  it deliberately is NOT is a shared message array — see GroupChatPrompt for
//  the projection that lets each member run in its own session instead.
//
//  Storage mirrors how AgentProfile is split:
//    - metadata + membership → `agent_groups` / `agent_group_members` in minis.db
//    - the transcript        → an ordinary `sessions` row, spawn_role = 'group'
//    - a member's own thread → a `sessions` row, spawn_role = 'group-member',
//                              agent_id = the member, parent_session_id = the group
//  Nothing lives on disk: a group has no persona and no memory of its own. Its
//  members bring theirs.
//
