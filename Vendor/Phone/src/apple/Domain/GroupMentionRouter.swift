//  GroupMentionRouter.swift
//  Minis
//
//  Who speaks next in a group. Pure functions over values — no store, no view
//  model, no actor — so the routing rules can be tested exhaustively without a
//  model call, a database or a device.
//
//  The turn-taking mechanics (round rotation, the delta window, the `(pass)`
//  protocol) are grok-bot 0.18's, from
//  modules/grok-bot-0.18-reconstructed/source/host/groups/group-chat.ts. Two
//  things here are deliberately NOT grok's:
//
//  1. **Routing policy.** grok's default is broadcast — a message with no
//     mentions wakes everybody. Ours is directed; see `resolveResponders`.
//
//  2. **Mentions address an id, not a name.** grok matches the text `@ann`
//     against a member called "Ann". That is how WeChat does it, and it is
//     wrong for the same reasons: rename an agent and every past mention
//     silently re-points or dies, two agents with similar names are a coin
//     flip, and a model that gets one character wrong addresses nobody with no
//     way to notice. Every real IM stores the id and shows the name — Slack
//     `<@U024BE7LH>`, Discord `<@123456789>`, Matrix a matrix.to link — so
//     that is what a stored group message carries too:
//
//         canonical (DB, LLM prompt, routing):  你说得对 <@a3f1…> 来看下
//         rendered  (UI, hardware, history):    你说得对 @市场专家 来看下
//
//     `encode` goes name → token on the way in from the composer, `render`
//     goes token → name at every presentation boundary, and `parseMentions`
//     only trusts tokens. Bare names still resolve as a tolerated fallback so a
//     model that forgets the format is not silently ignored — but a token, when
//     present, is authoritative and exact.
