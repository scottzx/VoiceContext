//
//  AgentDirectoryTools.swift
//  Minis
//
//  The roster as a tool surface: an agent can hire a colleague, look up who
//  else exists, and talk to them.
//
//  These three sit deliberately OUTSIDE the orchestrator/standalone split that
//  SubagentTools lives on. Dispatching work is a property of how an agent
//  works; knowing your colleagues is a property of being an agent at all, so
//  the 总管 and the 全能助手 both get the same surface. What gates them instead
//  is `agentRole`: only a `.main` session sees them, for the same reason a
//  subagent cannot spawn subagents — an executor that could mint agents or
//  start conversations between them would make the graph unbounded and leave
//  the user with a roster nobody asked for.
//
//  On the messaging shape
//  ----------------------
//  Modelled on Grok Bot's `task(resume:)`: a message addressed at an EXISTING
//  agent id rather than a fresh spawn, delivered into the conversation that
//  agent already has, with the same two rules that design settled on —
//
//    - a busy target is a refusal, not a queue. Silently stacking messages
//      behind a running turn hides the contention; `interrupt: true` is the
//      explicit opt-in, and it is the caller who has to decide.
//    - direct delivery is always asynchronous. The caller gets a task id
//      immediately and receives the peer's terminal result through an
//      async_task_notice.
//
//  Group A2A extends that same tool rather than adding a parallel verb. A
//  direct message is `is_group:false + agent_id[] + message`; a pseudo-group
//  message is `is_group:true + group_id + agent_id[] + message`. The latter writes one public line into
//  the group's shared transcript, then the group orchestrator projects that
//  transcript into each addressed member's private group-member session.
//
//  The one thing that is NOT borrowed: a subagent's transcript is scratch, but
//  a peer agent's main session is a conversation the user reads. So an inbound
//  message lands as a visibly attributed user turn, not a hidden injection.
//

        ## Your colleagues

        Other assistants live in this app alongside you. Each has its own \
        persona, its own memory and its own long-running conversation with the \
        user, and none of them can see yours.

        - list_agents: who exists, what each is for, and whether it is busy.
        - send_agent_message: use `is_group: false` + an `agent_id` list for \
        a private broadcast, or `is_group: true` + explicit `group_id` + an \
        `agent_id` list for a group's shared transcript. Private deliveries \
        return a task_id immediately and report replies asynchronously.
        - create_agent: hire a new one. It shows up in the user's roster \
        immediately.

        Message a colleague when it genuinely knows something you do not, or \
        when the matter is theirs. Do not route ordinary work through them \
        because it feels like delegation — a peer answers as itself, in its \
        own conversation, where the user can read it. \(insteadOfDelegating)

        ## send_agent_message call format

        `is_group` is required. `agent_id` is always a JSON list, even when it
        has only one recipient. Never use the old scalar agent_id form or an
        `agent_ids` field.

        - Private broadcast: `{ "is_group": false, "agent_id": ["<agent-id>"],
          "message": "..." }`. Omit group_id. Every listed agent receives the
          same private message as an independent asynchronous task. interrupt
          works only here.
        - Group A2A: `{ "is_group": true, "group_id": "<group-id>",
          "agent_id": ["<member-id>"], "message": "..." }`. This writes one
          public line to the shared transcript and wakes only those members.
        - Group owner broadcast: `{ "is_group": true, "group_id": "<group-id>",
          "agent_id": ["at_all"], "message": "..." }`. Only the owner may
          use at_all. If at_all appears with any ids, at_all wins and the ids
          are ignored.

        In group mode, put recipients only in agent_id and keep message as
        plain visible prose: do not put @name, <@id>, agent_ids, or an at_all
        parameter inside the message.

        Create an agent when the user asks for one, or when some standing part \
        of their life clearly wants a dedicated assistant rather than a corner \
        of yours. Give it a real persona, tell the user it now exists and \
        where to find it, and stop there — do not create a second agent as a \
        way of solving one task.

        When a message from another assistant arrives in YOUR conversation it \
        is shown as such. Answer it as you would answer a colleague: if they \
        are waiting, your final reply for that turn is what they receive \
        verbatim, so make it stand on its own and skip the clarifying question \
        nobody is there to answer. The user is reading over your shoulder \
        either way.

        A GROUP is a shared transcript projected into one private member \
        session per assistant, not a permanently open chat connection. When a \
        group turn gives you its group_id, use the Group A2A format above to \
        hand off. That public message is \
        what wakes those members; a private agent_id message does not.
