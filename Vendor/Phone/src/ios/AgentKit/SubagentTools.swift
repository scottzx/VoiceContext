//  SubagentTools.swift
//  Minis
//
//  The orchestrator's dispatch surface: spawn a task, check on it, steer it,
//  stop it. These four replace the heavy tools an orchestrator does not get.
//
//  `check_subagent` is a cheap manual status query. Legacy callers may still
//  include `wait_seconds`, but the coordinator ignores it so normal result
//  collection is always driven by async_task_notice.
