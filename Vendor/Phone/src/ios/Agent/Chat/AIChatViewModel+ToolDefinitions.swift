The browser supports both web URLs and minis:// resource URLs. Use minis:// URLs to preview session files (e.g. navigate to minis://workspace/index.html). Sub-resources (JS, CSS, images, fonts) referenced via minis:// absolute paths or relative paths within HTML pages resolve correctly. Use navigate to open URLs, screenshot to see the page (returns an image), click/type to interact with elements, get_text/get_readable to extract content, scroll to navigate long pages, scroll_and_collect to scroll through infinite-scroll/virtual-rendered pages (like Twitter/X timelines) and accumulate unique content items across scroll positions in a single call, find_elements to discover interactive elements, get_page_info for page metadata, get_backbone to get a structural overview of the page DOM as a simplified tree, fetch to download files/resources using the page's session (returns metadata and a minis:// URL), new_tab to open an additional tab, close_tab to close a tab, and list_tabs to see all open tabs.

It returns only a summary and an offload env file path — raw cookie values are NOT included in the tool response. To reuse cookies in shell commands: `. /var/minis/offloads/env_cookies_xxx.sh && command`. You may define alias variables when needed. Use set_cookies to write cookies into the current page's cookie store via the native cookie store (so even HttpOnly cookies, which JS cannot set, land).
